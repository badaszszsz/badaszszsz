- 👋 Hi, I’m @badaszszsz
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, automated testing and security aspects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Chrome Extensions development with JS and cross-platform app dev in Flutter and Dart.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Security research on JS, Flutter or any web bug bounty platform project (which allow us to do so!)
- 📫 How to reach me - leave me the note in one of projects/forks. Follow me or just comment this file :) That should be fastest.
